Types of SOC (Security Operations Center)

 In soc types, there are 6 (six) types of SOC.

1. Private SOC (In-house SOC):-

The company builds and runs its own SOC.
All security experts, tools, and systems belong to the company itself.

Example: A bank hires its own security team and sets up a SOC inside its office.

2. Completely Outsourced SOC:-

The company gives all security monitoring work to an outside vendor.
The vendor runs the SOC for them.

3. Hybrid SOC:-

A mix of in-house + outsourced.
The company keeps some security team in-house, but also takes help from an external SOC provider.

4. Command SOC:-

Works like a central hub (head office) that controls and coordinates multiple SOCs.

Example: A global company has SOCs in India, USA, and Europe → a command SOC oversees them all.

5. MSP Outsourced SOC (Managed Service Provider SOC):-

Security is handled by an MSP (Managed Service Provider).
The MSP provides tools, people, and monitoring as a monthly service.

6. Virtual SOC (vSOC):-

No physical SOC room. Everything is cloud-based.
Security analysts work remotely and monitor using online tools.

✅ Summary in one line each:-

Private SOC → Company’s own SOC.
Outsourced SOC → Fully given to vendor.
Hybrid SOC → Mix of in-house + vendor.
Command SOC → Central SOC that controls others.
MSP SOC → Managed security as a monthly service.
Virtual SOC → Cloud-based, remote SOC.
