SOC INTRODUCTION

In cybersecurity, a SOC stands for Security Operations Center.

It is a centralized team or facility where cybersecurity experts monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents in real time.

Think of it as the "control room" of an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity.

Key Functions of a SOC:

Monitoring â€“ Continuously watching network traffic, systems, and logs for threats.

Detection â€“ Using tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to identify suspicious activities.

Analysis â€“ Investigating alerts to separate false alarms from real threats.

Response â€“ Taking action against cyberattacks (blocking IPs, isolating systems, patching vulnerabilities).

Prevention â€“ Strengthening defenses to reduce future risks.

Compliance & Reporting â€“ Ensuring the organization follows security standards and creating reports for audits.

Common Tools Used in a SOC:

SIEM tools (Splunk, QRadar, ELK stack)

IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)

Firewalls, EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response), Threat Intel platforms

ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms: A SOC is like the 24/7 security guard team of a company, but instead of guarding doors, they guard data, networks, and systems.
