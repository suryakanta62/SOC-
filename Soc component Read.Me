SOC COMPONENT 

In the Security Operation Center (SOC), today's digital world, every organization want a SOC to secure its data. It is the backbone of every organization now a days.

SOC components into simple categories define :-

1) People (SOC Team Members):-

The human backbone of a SOC:-

a) SOC Analysts (L1, L2, L3) → Detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
b) Incident Responders → Contain and remediate attacks.
c) Threat Hunters → Proactively search for hidden threats.
d) SOC Manager → Oversees operations and team performance.
e)Compliance & Risk Officers → Ensure legal/regulatory requirements.

2) Process (SOC Workflows & Procedures):-

Standardized methods to ensure consistent security monitoring:-

a) Incident Detection & Response (IDR)
b) Triage & Escalation (deciding priority of alerts)
c) Playbooks & Runbooks (step-by-step procedures)
d) Change Management & Patch Management
e) Reporting & Documentation
f) Continuous Improvement (Lessons Learned)

3) Technology Stack (Tools & Platforms):-

The tech foundation that powers the SOC:-

a) SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) – Collects and correlates logs.
b) SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response) – Automates responses.
c) EDR/XDR (Endpoint/Extended Detection & Response) – Endpoint threat visibility.
d) IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems) – Detects network intrusions.
e) Firewalls & WAF (Web Application Firewall)
f) Threat Intelligence Platforms
g) Vulnerability Scanners

4) SOC Governance:-

Defines how the SOC operates and aligns with business needs:-

a) Policies & Procedures → Security rules and guidelines.
b) Compliance & Regulations → GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001.
c) KPIs & Metrics → MTTR (Mean Time to Respond), alert handling, SLA tracking.
d) Risk Management → Assessing and reducing cyber risks.
e) Audits & Reviews → Regular checks for improvements.

5) Data Sources:-

Logs and events that feed the SOC for monitoring:-

a) Network logs → Routers, firewalls, IDS/IPS.
b) Endpoint logs → Servers, desktops, laptops.
c) Application logs → Web apps, databases.
d) Cloud logs → AWS, Azure, GCP.
e) Identity logs → Active Directory, IAM systems.
f) Threat intelligence feeds.

6) Threat Intelligence:-

Knowledge that helps predict, detect, and respond to cyber threats:-

a) Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) → Malicious IPs, hashes, domains.
b) Indicators of Attack (IoAs) → Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
c) Threat Feeds → External sources (OSINT, commercial feeds).
d) Dark Web Monitoring → Tracking leaked data or chatter.
e) Threat Actor Profiling → Understanding attacker groups and motives.
