SOC Functions


A Security Operations Center (SOC) plays a critical role in safeguarding an organization’s digital ecosystem. Its functions revolve around continuous monitoring, detection, analysis, and response to cyber threats. 

1️⃣ Collect Telemetry Data from Available Resources:-

The SOC aggregates telemetry data from various sources like firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, endpoint security tools, SIEMs, cloud platforms, and application logs.
This data acts as the “eyes and ears” of the SOC.
It enables real-time visibility across networks, devices, and applications.
By centralizing telemetry, analysts can correlate events that might otherwise go unnoticed.

2️⃣ Gather Threat Intelligence & Understand Threat Actors:-

SOC teams utilize internal and external threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of evolving attack techniques.
Helps analysts recognize the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries.
Provides context on who the threat actor is, what their motive might be, and how they operate.
Enables proactive defense by detecting early indicators of compromise (IoCs).

3️⃣ Create & Rank Alerts Based on Business Risk:-

Not every alert has the same level of urgency. The SOC prioritizes alerts based on their potential business impact.
Alerts are categorized into severity levels (critical, high, medium, low).
Risk ranking ensures SOC resources are focused on what truly matters to the business.
This minimizes alert fatigue and enables faster, more efficient triage.

4️⃣ Promptly Respond to Incidents & Minimize Impact:-

When incidents occur, the SOC acts as the first line of defense.
Analysts investigate, contain, and remediate threats to reduce damage.
Incident response playbooks and automation help in quick containment.
Goal: ensure business continuity, reduce downtime, and protect sensitive data.
